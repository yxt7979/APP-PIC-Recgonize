## About
It can help you Identify the content and scene of the images.    

## Aim
A practise for my project "Everything is Music".    
To learn how to use API.    

## Attention
1.The size of the picture that you wanna to choose **can not be larger than 4M**.     
2.I have put my own API keys and the Secret Keys here as nobody is going to see this simple project, but it is also very nice of you to use your own key!

PSï¼šI do not like to write an readme in English... Maybe I have to focue on English...
